		<description><![CDATA[This, as coded above doesn&#039;t quite work for me in Tasker. The problem lies in this section:-

Data / File:{&quot;method&quot;:&quot;passthrough&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;deviceId&quot;: &quot;%deviceId&quot;, &quot;requestData&quot;: &quot;{&quot;system&quot;:{&quot;set_relay_state&quot;:{&quot;state&quot;:%state}}}&quot; }}

The Tasker variable %deviceId is in quotes and as such Tasker will see it as a String Literal and not decode it.

I got around this by removing the quotes BUT replacing them around the deviceId string when the variable %deviceId is first declared.

Thanks for posting this article.]]></description>
