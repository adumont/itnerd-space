		<description><![CDATA[PS - as per an earlier post I have found that my token expires and I need to discover the new one, and then that will need embedding to replace the old in each applet again - easy but a bit of a pain, would be happy if anyone has a solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes works well, and doesn&#039;t need any programming skills, I just had to populate the .env file and create a webhooks routine applet for each task. For example create an applet that would turn off kitchen lights, same for kitchen plugs etc, then list these in the .env. Very easy once I&#039;d figured out how to make the instructions work, plus learnt much more about the webhooks service which will help with another challenge I have set myself - I want to remotely control my ageing home burglar alarm via webcalls and an arduino interface ... getting there slowly in small steps at present.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice Jeremy! I didn&#039;t know this service. It will definitely help all, as one can recreate like a scene and trigger it with one webhook call in Maker. What I didn&#039;t know was the approach they took in Glitch, to trigger IFTTT applets.  I was looking into an alternative to Glitch, Webtasks, also free. I&#039;ll try to write up an article about another alternative I know, which might be easier for non programmers, and still do all the steps (including logging in, retrieving the token,...). I only need time to write it... ]]></description>

works great , would be even better if I could work a timer in. so far I can turn on one night and turn off everything else, but would like to have a timer to turn that light off too after 2 mins or something.]]></description>
