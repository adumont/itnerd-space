		<description><![CDATA[In the case above, he wasn&#039;t testing in IFTTT, but in jsonlint which appears to have different formatting rules than IFTTT. With IFTTT, you had to have the curly braces on different lines, with jsonlint, you had to bring them together. Different online sites with different ways of interpreting the input. In reality, either one, technically, should be fine. But you work with what you have. :) 

If he&#039;s going to be testing his code on jsonlint, he&#039;s going to need to adjust his curly brace location there, but then re-adjust once he brings it over to IFTTT]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hoping either the OP or someone else with more JSON knowledge than me can assist. Got this working smoothly (thanks to the OP as well as some of the tips I saw in the comments. Thank you everyone!) 

I&#039;m attempting to tie this into my alarm system so that when my alarm is triggered, IFTTT will flash the lights. As it works now, it will turn the lights ON, but I&#039;m unable to figure out how to string multiple commands, so the connection sends a state ON/state OFF/state ON/state OFF etc. 

Any thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had the same issue. The problem ended up being the rows the braces were on. It had to be formatted as below for it to work.

{
	&quot;method&quot;: &quot;passthrough&quot;,
	&quot;params&quot;: {
		&quot;deviceId&quot;: &quot;800676FD5F0A287A6137E090F5DD916D183CXXXX&quot;,
		&quot;requestData&quot;: &quot;{&quot;system&quot;:{&quot;set_relay_state&quot;:{&quot;state&quot;:1}}}&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[I believe that&#039;s because IFTTT notation for ingredients (variables) is like this {{name}}. In your caer IFTTT understands your }} as the end of an ingredient name, and is missing the opening. My advice try to separate every } with a new line to avoid confusion.]]></description>
