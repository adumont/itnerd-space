		<description><![CDATA[Alex, this has been very useful, thank you for he time you have invested in this and sharing with the community. All progressed well, managed to work around the fact that I&#039;m a Windows guy not Linux etc for commands, but JSON is not my thing and I&#039;ve come to an impasse, the script does not work when I run it. I have tried it in Hurl.it, the getDevicelist works so I know the URL and my Token are correct. But when I try to change the switch state I get an error
{&quot;error_code&quot;:-10100,&quot;msg&quot;:&quot;JSON format error&quot;}

script is:
{
&quot;method&quot;: &quot;passthrough&quot;,
&quot;params&quot;: {
&quot;deviceId&quot;: &quot;800676FD5F0A287A6137E090F5DD916D183CXXXX&quot;,
&quot;requestData&quot;: &quot;{&quot;system&quot;:{&quot;set_relay_state&quot;:{&quot;state&quot;:1}
}
}
&quot; }
}

When I put the JSON script through a validator: https://jsonlint.com/
I get the error like this...

Error: Parse error on line 5:
...&quot;,	&quot;requestData&quot;: &quot;{&quot;system&quot;:{&quot;set_
----------------------^
Expecting &#039;STRING&#039;, &#039;NUMBER&#039;, &#039;NULL&#039;, &#039;TRUE&#039;, &#039;FALSE&#039;, &#039;{&#039;, &#039;[&#039;, got &#039;undefined&#039;

ANy ideas what I am doing wrong ? - I copied and pasted the script from the instructions so don&#039;t believe I have a formatting error etc.

Many thanks

		<description><![CDATA[It seems that TP Link server is rejecting the white spaces between the closing }, even carriage return to bypass IFTTT doesnt work anymore. 
Anyone else facing this issue ? 
I tested it out using https://www.hurl.it/]]></description>

Anyway I&#039;m working on a new way which would render this pretty much obsolete, a new way I believe much more powerful, although maybe trickier. ]]></description>
