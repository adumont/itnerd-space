I&#039;m currently trying to get this working in Windows 10 via invoke-webrequest, but only getting the &quot;Token expired.&quot;]]></description>

I somehow was able to use the token to get my device list but now the same token will not work when using curl in my terminal too control the light. I am getting a token expired message.
