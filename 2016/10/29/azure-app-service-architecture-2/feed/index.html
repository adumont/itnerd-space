		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mathieu,
This is a situation I am not very familiar with, so don&#039;t quote me on this. Indeed, VNet peering may be the way to establish connectivity between your App and your Cassandra cluster.
Another option maybe would be to publish the Casandra cluster with a public IP, so the web app can connect to it directly. You should be able to filter incoming traffic to the cluster using NSG to only allow the web app. (I am assuming the cluster is also hosted on Azure in IaaS VM).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi, i have a question. I &#039;m facing a problem actually using appService. 
I&#039;ve build a Linux SQL cluster (DSE Cassandra) and my website (hosted in an appservice) need to talk with my cluster. The problem is, my Vnet gateway is already used by my ExpressRoute circuit. So ... i can&#039;t connect my website to my cluster.
Do you have any idea ? 
I&#039;m going to give a try to vnet peering (using an ASE).

Anyway, nice article.]]></description>
