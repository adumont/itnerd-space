Then I got an HS100 TP-Link smartplug: a &#8220;connected thing&#8221;, a plug that is connected to Internet (don&#8217;t say that to any person, most will look at you like o.0?!), a plug that you can control from an App on your phone, from wherever you are: at home, or from outside: from anywhere in the world. And  I guess Oops I did it again!</p>
<h2>Interface the HS100 with everything</h2>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist to imagine many potential applications and possible integrations with online (cloud) services that are publicly and freely available, like IFTTT; I&#8217;m also a big fan of Android Tasker, Node-Red, the MQTT pub/sub protocol, and Raspberry Pi / NodeMCU hooked with sensors and hardware pieces attached on the GPIO pins) that make more <em>connected things</em>, so literally ideas are all over the places in my heads, on papers, in Keep notes&#8230;</p>
<p>Like this one that just popped in my mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Switch off the main lights in the salon, dim the lights around the sofa and TV, power on the media server box (smartplug) and TV when I sit on the sofa, with a NodeMCU controller and a pressure sensor (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTO3U-0Njtw">FSR</a>)! Or maybe I&#8217;d prefer to have all that triggered when I power on the TV, but only in a certain time slot?&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Told you I have crasy ideas ;). Totally got to try to do that BTW!</p>
<h2>Error: Time not found</h2>
<p>What I only lack really is time. First, time to try and make some of those idea work (they do eventually with perseverence and I always learn a lot in the process), then time to write about them (here).</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize the time it take to write articles people need to write good articles. I usually take notes of what I do, notes that I understand, but publishing those is no value to anyone. You need to structure the ideas, give them some form so the result make sense for the reader, enough at least so they can be inspired in trying also themselves to do, learn and make something that work for them out of what I wrote. Unfortunately due to the lack of time, I don&#8217;t enter into too much details, and I assume the reader is tech-savvy enough to read, understand and try by himself. That means some reader gets frustrated because I missed some parts they didn&#8217;t know&#8230; Sorry about that.</p>
<h2>Wins so far</h2>
<p>Back to the HS100: there were some (very good) resources publicly available already out there that showed how to interact with an HS100 plug, from shell scripts based on cURL, php and python libraries or Node.js modules, even a Node-Red. But they all had the same problem: they only worked withing the same local network (WiFi/LAN) the plug was connected to. Ugh bummer.</p>
<p>The Kasa App and the Alexa integration were proof that TP-Link was hosting a cloud service, but no API was publicly available yet.</p>
<p>So I started to work on figuring out how the App talked to the TP-Link Cloud endpoint, and started to publish it here. The series got (modestly) popular among the maker and tinkerers ;), and people used the comments to exchange ideas, issues, and come with solutions. So far, I&#8217;ve published (not in chronological order)</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far the whole process was rather hacky and manual I reckon, but still one could achieve the goal of switching a smartplug from a remote place (outside of the smartplug local network), like from one&#8217;s smartphone (Tasker), or an IFTTT recipe. It already enabled some cool logics.</p>
<h2>Pitfalls: what about scenes?</h2>
<p>Soon after having found out how to trigger one TP-Link HS100 smartplug, the most frequently asked question in the comments has been <span style="color: #ff0000;">¿how can I power On/Off multiple devices from ITFFF?</span></p>
<p>After all it&#8217;s a feature that people know from the Kasa App: you define buttons in the app that will put several of you smartplugs in a state you define.</p>
<p>Related to my idea above, a scene would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Time to w<em>atch some TV</em>&#8221; scene: Switch off the main lights in the salon, dim the lights around the sofa and TV, power on the media server box (smartplug) and TV.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can define that in Kasa, but what about calling it from IFTTT? You can&#8217;t. You can only call one POST call (via Maker), in an IFTTT recipe.</p>
<p>The second to most request in the mind of all is probably related to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">TOKEN that will eventually expire</span> sooner of later, making it a hassle to edit all your IFTTT Recipes/Tasker tasks/whatever scripts&#8230; manually!</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m happy to say this was until now!</p>
<h1>More Wins coming soon&#8230;</h1>
<p>This week I&#8217;ve been working hard on this (it&#8217;s the second time I try it, and this time I made it!).</p>
<p>This is what I have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve created a <strong>node.js module</strong> to easily interact (power On/Off, get state) with any number of HS100/HS110 smartplugs and LB100/LB110/LB120 and LB130 smartbulbs (set on/off, set brightness, set color). The module handles the login, token retrieval, and device triggering, in almost no call.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve created a <strong>Glitch example app</strong> in which one can define scenes. As Glitch publishes a URL, you can then trigger one &#8220;scene&#8221; with only one call (http://url.glich.me/scene1/) and with only one POST call it will do whatever you want to! Not only that but you can even define as many scenes as you want in a single Glitch app ( each with a different end-point: http://url.glich.me/scene2/, http://url.glich.me/scene3/&#8230;).</li>
<li>Next I will create a library of new TP-Link Node-Red nodes to control the smartthings from Node-Red!</li>
</ul>
<p>All that is already working fine for me, so this is what I&#8217;ll talk about in next posts (and I&#8217;ll publish the code for everything <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) when I get some more time to talk about it. (Believe it or not, it took me more than two hours to write this post)!</p>
<p>So, <strong>stay tuned</strong> if you are interested. I suggest you follow me on Twitter, and follow this blog, recommend on Disqus (the heart icon).</p>
<p>Ah and well&#8230; all this is free, but you might see some interesting (or not) Ads around my content. I won&#8217;t mind if you all start clicking everywhere. I&#8217;m not suggesting anything&#8230; :p</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve seen in a previous post what is the <a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/06/19/how-to-authenticate-to-tp-link-cloud-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protocol to authenticate to TP Link cloud API</a>. Now, what about doing that from <strong>Tasker</strong> you can ask me? Well, that&#8217;s very simple actually!</p>
<p>To implement that in Tasker I have used <em>RESTask for Tasker</em> (because I had troubles having the native HTTP Post action work for me):</p>
<!-- WP-Appbox (Version: 4.0.15 // Store: googleplay // ID: com.freehaha.restask) --><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freehaha.restask&hl=en" title="RESTask for Tasker">RESTask for Tasker (Free, Google Play) →</a></p><!-- /WP-Appbox -->
<p>Next create 3 global variables in Tasker (self-explanatory I guess):</p>
<ul>
<li>TPLUSER</li>
<li>TPLPASS</li>
<li>TPLTERM (use the UUIDv4 you got above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then create a new Task with the following 4 actions:</p>
<p>The first action will be a Variable Set %payload:</p>
<pre>Name:%payload
To: { "method" :"login",
"params" : {
  "appType" :"Kasa_Android",
  "cloudPassword" :"%TPLPASS",
  "cloudUserName" :"%TPLUSER",
  "terminalUUID" :"%TPLTERM" } }</pre>
<p>The second action will be the RESTask call:</p>

<p>The third action will be a Javascriptlet with the following code, to extract the token (from the rtres, passed from  RESTask) to the %mtoken variable:</p>
<pre>var mtoken = JSON.parse(rtres).result.token;</pre>
<p>Finally, here the fourth action will just be a Flash action, that will show the token:</p>
<pre>Flash [ Text:%mtoken Long:On ]</pre>
<p>The whole task should end up looking like this:</p>

<p>You can run the Task and it should flash the token on the screen!! Yay</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is breaking news! No need to hack into your phone&#8217;s backups any more to obtain the TP-Link token!</p>
<p>First you need to generate an UUID v4. You can open <a href="https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4">https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4</a> and pick the one they give you there (no need to create one every time, one is fine, just keep it). This will represent your Client Term ID (like the one of your Kasa App).</p>
<p>Now this is how you can authenticate to the TP Link cloud backend and obtain a <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>token</strong></span>:</p>
<p>We have to do a POST request to https://wap.tplinkcloud.com, with the following payload:</p>
<pre>{
 "method": "login",
 "params": {
 "appType": "Kasa_Android",
 "cloudUserName": "XXXXX",
 "cloudPassword": "XXXXX",
 "terminalUUID": "MY_UUID_v4"
 }
}</pre>
<p>In the payload, replace cloudUserName and cloudPassword with your TP-Link (or Kasa) credentials, and the terminalUUID with the one you got above.</p>
<p>Remember to pass the Header Content-Type: application/json as well.</p>
<p>No need to have any extra tool, you can simply try it with <a href="http://Hurl.it">Hurl.it</a> from your browser:</p>
<p><a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/06/19/how-to-authenticate-to-tp-link-cloud-api/screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19/" rel="attachment wp-att-346"><img data-attachment-id="346" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/2017/06/19/how-to-authenticate-to-tp-link-cloud-api/screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?fit=592%2C372" data-orig-size="592,372" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2017-06-20 00-21-19" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?fit=300%2C189" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?fit=592%2C372" class="aligncenter wp-image-346 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?resize=592%2C372" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?w=592 592w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?resize=300%2C189 300w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-from-2017-06-20-00-21-19.png?resize=30%2C19 30w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll get should look like this:</p>
<pre>{
 "error_code": 0,
 "result": {
 "regTime": "2017-01-06 08:42:35",
 "email": "XXXXX",
 <span style="color: #008000;">"token": "<strong>YOUR_TOKEN_HERE</strong>"</span>
 }
}</pre>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that cool? Of course you can implement that in any language, Shell script with <a href="https://curlbuilder.com/">cURL</a>, Python, Node.js,&#8230; Your token is response.result.token.</p>
<p>In a next post I&#8217;ll show how to <a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/06/19/how-to-authenticate-to-tp-link-cloud-api-with-tasker/">do the same with Tasker</a>! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>From here you can also have a look at this post: <a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/05/21/how-to-get-the-tp-link-hs100-cloud-end-point-url/">Get the end point URL and HS100 Device ID.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to a <a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/#comment-3341335326">comment by Jacob K</a>. on a previous post, I looked into how to set/unset the HS100 plug timer via the TP-Link API call.</p>
<p>To replay the steps below, be sure to already have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/">your TP-Link token</a></li>
<li><a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/">your HS100 deviceId</a></li>
<li><a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/05/21/how-to-get-the-tp-link-hs100-cloud-end-point-url/">your TP-Link app server URL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, I recommend you use <a href="https://www.hurl.it/">Hurl.it</a> service to test the API calls, it&#8217;s the easiest way.</p>
<h2>First let&#8217;s retrieve the timer Rule ID</h2>
<p>Destination:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">POST <a href="https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.com/?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.<wbr />com/?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE</a></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div>Body:</div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">{&#8220;method&#8221;:&#8221;passthrough&#8221;, &#8220;params&#8221;: {&#8220;deviceId&#8221;: &#8220;YOUR_DEVICE_ID_HERE&#8221;, &#8220;requestData&#8221;: &#8220;{\&#8221;count_down\&#8221;:{\&#8221;get_rules\<wbr />&#8220;:null}}&#8221; }}</span></div>
</blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have followed my series on how to control the TP-Link HS100 smart plug by communicating with TP-Link Cloud services, you might have seen that there are some common issues related to the URL one need to point the requests to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found out a way to know what is the URL, no more hit and miss needed any more!</p>
<p>The only thing that you&#8217;ll need is your TP-Link token (<a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/">see how to get it</a>). In a terminal, run the following command:</p>
<pre>curl -s --request POST "https://wap.tplinkcloud.com?token=<span style="color: #800080;">YOUR_TOKEN_HERE</span> HTTP/1.1" \
 --data '{"method":"getDeviceList"}' \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json"</pre>
<p>As an alternative, you can use <a href="http://hurl.it">hurl.it</a>, an online version of curl, like shown on the picture below:</p>
<p><a href="http://itnerd.space/hurl-getdevicelist/"><img data-attachment-id="331" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/2017/05/21/how-to-get-the-tp-link-hs100-cloud-end-point-url/hurl-getdevicelist/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?fit=677%2C493" data-orig-size="677,493" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hurl-getDeviceList" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;https://www.hurl.it&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?fit=300%2C218" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?fit=677%2C493" class="wp-image-331 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?resize=677%2C493" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?w=677 677w, https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?resize=300%2C218 300w, https://i0.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hurl-getDeviceList.png?resize=30%2C22 30w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As Parameters use simply this:</p>
<pre>{"method":"getDeviceList"}</pre>
<p>As the name of the method implies, this will list all your HS100 devices (maybe other, please tell me what you see!). You should get something like this:</p>
<pre>{
 "result" : {
 "deviceList" : [
 {
<span style="color: #339966;"> "<strong>appServerUrl</strong>" : "https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.com",</span>
 "isSameRegion" : true,
 "deviceMac" : "",
 "status" : 1,
 "hwId" : "XXXX....",
 <span style="color: #339966;">"<strong>deviceId</strong>" : "XXXX....",</span>
 "oemId" : "XXXX....",
 "fwVer" : "1.0.8 Build 151101 Rel.24452",
 "deviceType" : "IOT.SMARTPLUGSWITCH",
 <span style="color: #339966;">"<strong>alias</strong>" : "My Smart Plug",</span>
 "fwId" : "BFF24826FBC561803E49379DBE74FD71",
 "deviceName" : "Wi-Fi Smart Plug",
 "deviceHwVer" : "1.0",
 "role" : 0,
 "deviceModel" : "HS100(EU)"
 }
 ]
 },
 "error_code" : 0
}</pre>
<p>In the results above, we&#8217;ll get a list of all our TPLink devices, with their <em>alias</em> (the custom name we have given it), the <em>deviceId</em>, and the <em>appServerUrl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>appServerUrl</em> is the one we&#8217;ll need to use in further POST requests, to control the plug.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve seen in a previous post <a href="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/">how to switch our TP-Link HS100 smartplug from command line</a>, from anywhere (not only the local network). In this post we&#8217;ll see how to create some Tasker tasks to control our smartplug. From that, we can imagine any useful/crazy profiles triggered from any events, time, location and switch the plug On/Off, for example &#8220;when I arrive home, switch on the Christmas Tree&#8230;&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>To quickly recap, this is the command that can change the plug state (depending on the %state variable, 0: switch off, 1: switch on):</p>
<pre>curl --request POST "https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.com/?token=<span style="color: #800080;">%token</span> HTTP/1.1" \
  --data '{"method":"passthrough", "params": {"deviceId": "<span style="color: #800080;">%deviceId</span>", "requestData": "{\"system\":{\"set_relay_state\":{\"state\":<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>%state</strong></span>}}}" }}' \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json"</pre>
<h1>Task 1: Switch Plug On <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h1>
<h2>Using an HTTP Post action</h2>
<p>In Tasker let&#8217;s create a new Task called &#8220;Switch Plug On <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221;, then add  3 &#8220;Variable Set&#8221; actions, to set the value of %deviceId, %token and %state to the right values for you.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll use an HTTP Post action, that we&#8217;ll configure like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Server:Port</span>: https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.com</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Path</span>: ?token=%token</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data / File</span>: {&#8220;method&#8221;:&#8221;passthrough&#8221;, &#8220;params&#8221;: {&#8220;deviceId&#8221;: &#8220;%deviceId&#8221;, &#8220;requestData&#8221;: &#8220;{\&#8221;system\&#8221;:{\&#8221;set_relay_state\&#8221;:{\&#8221;state\&#8221;:%state}}}&#8221; }}</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timeout</span>: 30</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content Type</span>: application/json</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Remember to change the URL above to the one that works for you (check the <a href="/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/#CommonIssues">Common Issues</a> section at the end of first post and its comments).</p>
<p>The resulting Tasker Task will look like this:</p>

<p>In text form, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>Switch Plug On &#x1f4a1; (143)

<h2>Using a Run Shell action (2nd way)</h2>
<p>If you have curl available from the command line on your Android phone, you can alternatively use a Run Shell action, instead of the HTTP Post action.</p>
<p>In this case, the Tasker Task would look like this:</p>

<p>And in text form it would read like this:</p>

<h1>Task 2: Switch Off Plug</h1>
<p>Once you have the Switch On task working, you can simply clone it in Tasker and change the %state variable to 0, and that will give you the &#8220;Switch Off Plug&#8221; task!</p>
<h1>Profiles ideas</h1>
<p>Do not hesitate to contribute in the comments with any Profile idea you have to play with your TP-Link HS100 smartplug.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can acquire Tasker from the Play Store, personally I believe it&#8217;s really worth the money. You can also download a 7 days free trial from <a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/">Tasker official website</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Say you need to open a lot of URLs to see what they look like. Not in the mood for any more manual work, you prefer to automate the task? Let see how we can read a bunch of URL from an Excel file, load them in MSIE and take a screenshot of each of them. You'll have more time to analyse the results.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to <em>visually</em> check a lot of URLs, to see if the page was loading fine, or if it was giving any kind of error. So I had an Excel file with the name of some applications (Azure WebApps), and for each the list URLs of that site, and I needed to load each URL and see, in a browser, what the pages look like.</p>
<p>The good thing is that depending the result, I could easily identify it if I had a high level view of all the pages. That&#8217;s were the thumbnail view comes in!</p>
<p>To do that I needed to automate several individual steps that I would later combine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the list of Application names and URLs from an Excel spreadsheet. That part was easy, as I&#8217;m already a fond user of <a href="https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel">ImportExcel PowerShell module</a></li>
<li>Open a URL into a Browser. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23347472/728281">StackOverflow answer</a> helped me.</li>
<li>Take a screenshot, ideally of a specific portion of the screen. For that last part I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2970339/728281" target="_blank">this other scriplet</a> on SO.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I created a <em>Frankenstein</em> Powershell script combining all the pieces together, which you can see <a href="https://gist.github.com/adumont/bbdfbd0f63be8719b1af87d862a45c56">here</a>.</p>
<p>The input I&#8217;m using is an Excel file, of which I&#8217;ll use two columns: Name and Hostnames, which contains a list of comma-separated URLs, of which I&#8217;ll only take the first one. I&#8217;ll use the Name column to name the output screenshot file.</p>
<p>This is how the Excel file would look like:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png"><img data-attachment-id="179" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/03/batch-to-open-urls-and-take-screenshots/2017-01-04-11_14_08-book4-excel/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?fit=332%2C152" data-orig-size="332,152" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2017-01-04 11_14_08-Book4 &#8211; Excel" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?fit=300%2C137" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?fit=332%2C152" class="size-full wp-image-179 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?resize=332%2C152" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?w=332 332w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?resize=300%2C137 300w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_14_08-Book4-Excel.png?resize=30%2C14 30w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We load it using Import-Excel CmdLet. In the example case above, we would get:</p>
<pre>PS C:\&gt; Import-Excel D:\temp\file.xlsx

Name HostNames
---- ---------
google google.com, www.google.com
microsoft www.microsoft.com
yahoo yahoo.com</pre>
<p>I didn&#8217;t find a way to take a screenshot of a non visible window, so I am showing the browser, and taking the screenshot of the region. For my purpose it works and it&#8217;s quite simple, but that presents some disadvantages (you cannot use the region of the screen while running the script, or you risk altering the result in the screenshot).</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it involves some precaution and some manual preparation, to position the windows, and modify the script accordingly, the first time at least.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Powershell command line window</li>
<li>Run the following command. This will open an Internet Explorer window. Place it on your desktop, so that it will not overlap with the Powershell window. They can be side by side. It will be easier if you have two monitors, as you can place the browser window alone on a monitor.</li>
</ul>
<pre> $IE=new-object -com internetexplorer.application
 $IE.visible=$true</pre>
<ul>
<li>Run the following commands and take note of the results:</li>
</ul>
<pre> $IE.Top
 $IE.Left
 $IE.Width
 $IE.Height</pre>
<ul>
<li>Replace the results in the script. That way, each time we open a new browser the script will reposition it in the same location on your screen!</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you just have to run the script and it will do the job.</p>
<p>In the case of our example input file above, the output we&#8217;d get would look like in the output folder places in Thumbnail View:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png"><img data-attachment-id="181" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/03/batch-to-open-urls-and-take-screenshots/2017-01-04-11_53_35-new-folder/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?fit=572%2C435" data-orig-size="572,435" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2017-01-04 11_53_35-New folder" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?fit=300%2C228" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?fit=572%2C435" class="size-full wp-image-181 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?resize=572%2C435" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?w=572 572w, https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?resize=300%2C228 300w, https://i1.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-04-11_53_35-New-folder.png?resize=30%2C23 30w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In my particular use case, this below is what I was looking for:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png"><img data-attachment-id="174" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/2017/01/03/batch-to-open-urls-and-take-screenshots/2017-01-03-18_25_38-clipboard/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?fit=1334%2C671" data-orig-size="1334,671" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2017-01-03 18_25_38-Clipboard" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?fit=300%2C151" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?fit=700%2C352" class="size-full wp-image-174 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?resize=700%2C352" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?w=1334 1334w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?resize=300%2C151 300w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?resize=768%2C386 768w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?resize=1024%2C515 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-03-18_25_38-Clipboard.png?resize=30%2C15 30w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, by placing the images in Thumbnail View, we can rapidly identify and classify the corresponding Web sites into 4 groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Page seems to load fine</li>
<li>Default initial Azure page (possibly no content deployed)</li>
<li>Page doesn&#8217;t load, or takes too long</li>
<li>Some HTTP error</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, within the first category, a quick inspection of the image will show if the page loads apparently fine, or if it shows some content problem.</p>
<p>If you have hundreds of sites, it can save you some precious time!</p>
<p>Some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure what happens if the screen switch to screensaver mode. It may not work as expected. So, either deactivate the screensaver, or keep moving the mouse (out of the browser&#8217;s way) while the script runs.</li>
<li>I use a new IE instance for each new URL, that is, I don&#8217;t recycle the IE instance for several URLs, for a simple reason: if the URL doesn&#8217;t load, I would possibly take a screenshot of the previously loaded URL, which is not what I want.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Automation in Android, there is no doubt that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a> is the absolute king. Although I admit the UI is not fancy &#8212; at all,  and the learning curve is quite harsh, Tasker has demonstrated being the most powerful app in the Automation space.</p>
<!-- WP-Appbox (Version: 4.0.15 // Store: googleplay // ID: net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) --><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en" title="Tasker">Tasker (€2.99, Google Play) →</a></p><!-- /WP-Appbox -->
<p>One of the little know features of Tasker is the ability to run <em>Android Java</em> code, sort of.</p>
<p>That requires some learning, as everything in Tasker, but can prove very useful to further extend Tasker possibilities.</p>
<p>Let see a simple example, to illustrate the concept. Let say we want to enable Bluetooth. The corresponding Android Java code would be something like :</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="148" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/screenshot_20170101-174128-png/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?fit=1920%2C1080" data-orig-size="1920,1080" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot_20170101-174128.png" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?fit=300%2C169" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?fit=700%2C394" class="alignnone wp-image-148 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?resize=700%2C394" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?resize=300%2C169 300w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?resize=768%2C432 768w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?resize=30%2C17 30w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-174128.png?w=1400 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In Tasker we would use a couple of <em>Java Function</em> actions that we put in a <em>Tasker task</em> :</p>
<p>First:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">BluetoothAdapter bta = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();</pre>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png"><img data-attachment-id="149" data-permalink="http://itnerd.space/screenshot_20170101-175233-png/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?fit=1080%2C1920" data-orig-size="1080,1920" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot_20170101-175233.png" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?fit=169%2C300" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?fit=576%2C1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-149" src="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?resize=320%2C569" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?resize=169%2C300 169w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?resize=768%2C1365 768w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?resize=17%2C30 17w, https://i2.wp.com/itnerd.space/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_20170101-175233.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This is the resulting Tasker task:</p>
<pre>Bluetooth Enable (71)
 A1: Java Function [ Return:bta Class Or Object:BluetoothAdapter Function:getDefaultAdapter
{BluetoothAdapter} () Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: ] 
 A2: Java Function [ Return: Class Or Object:bta Function:enable
{boolean} () Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: Param: ]</pre>
<p>This is very powerful and can unleash some new possibilities.</p>
<p>Say you want to enable LinkedIn synchronization on WiFi only. Tasker has no native actions to handle Android accounts synchronization. You need to access the ContentResolver Java objects and methods. This is something  you can do with Tasker! I&#8217;ll detail this example in a future post.</p>
